### React Flow Visualization for Super AI Agents

**Description:**  
To enhance the usability and visualization of the **Super AI Agents Infrastructure**, we need to implement a **React Flow**-based interface that renders the relationships between agents (parent-child, dependencies, etc.) in a visually appealing and interactive manner. The interface should allow users to:  
1. Import agent relationships and metadata via JSON files (drag-and-drop support).  
2. Render the agent hierarchy and dependencies using React Flow.  
3. Edit agent details (e.g., system prompts, task prompts) directly on the screen.  
4. Save the updated JSON file with all changes.  

This feature will provide a clear, interactive, and editable visualization of the multi-agent ecosystem, making it easier to manage and debug agent relationships.

### Key Features and Requirements:

#### **1. JSON Structure for Agent Relationships:**
   - Define a JSON structure to represent agents, their relationships, and metadata.  
   - Example JSON structure:
     ```json
     {
       "agents": [
         {
           "agent_id": "agent_1",
           "parent_id": null,
           "related_agents": ["agent_2", "agent_3"],
           "role_name": "Market Research Agent",
           "system_prompt": "Conduct market research for new product launches.",
           "task_prompt": "Analyze market trends and customer preferences.",
           "metadata": {
             "creation_timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
             "llm_used": "Ollama"
           }
         },
         {
           "agent_id": "agent_2",
           "parent_id": "agent_1",
           "related_agents": ["agent_4"],
           "role_name": "Content Creation Agent",
           "system_prompt": "Create marketing content for campaigns.",
           "task_prompt": "Develop blog posts, social media content, and ads.",
           "metadata": {
             "creation_timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:05:00Z",
             "llm_used": "Ollama"
           }
         },
         {
           "agent_id": "agent_3",
           "parent_id": "agent_1",
           "related_agents": [],
           "role_name": "Budget Planning Agent",
           "system_prompt": "Plan marketing budgets for campaigns.",
           "task_prompt": "Allocate budget for different marketing channels.",
           "metadata": {
             "creation_timestamp": "2023-10-01T12:10:00Z",
             "llm_used": "Ollama"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

#### **2. React Flow Visualization:**
   - Use **React Flow** to render the agent hierarchy and relationships.  
   - Nodes represent agents, and edges represent relationships (e.g., parent-child, dependencies).  
   - Each node should display:
     - Agent ID
     - Role Name
     - System Prompt
     - Task Prompt
   - Allow users to click on nodes to view and edit agent details.

#### **3. JSON Import/Export:**
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality to import JSON files.  
   - Parse the JSON file and render the agent relationships in React Flow.  
   - Allow users to export the updated JSON file after making edits.

#### **4. Editing Capabilities:**
   - Enable users to edit agent details (e.g., system prompts, task prompts) directly on the screen.  
   - Provide a form or modal for editing agent metadata.  
   - Save changes to the JSON structure in real-time.

#### **5. User Interface:**
   - Create a clean and intuitive UI for the React Flow visualization.  
   - Include a sidebar or panel for displaying and editing agent details.  
   - Add buttons for importing/exporting JSON files.

### Workflow:

1. **Import JSON:**
   - User drags and drops a JSON file into the interface.  
   - The system parses the JSON and renders the agent relationships in React Flow.

2. **Visualize Agents:**
   - Nodes (agents) and edges (relationships) are displayed on the screen.  
   - Users can click on nodes to view agent details.

3. **Edit Agent Details:**
   - Users can edit system prompts, task prompts, and other metadata.  
   - Changes are saved to the JSON structure in real-time.

4. **Export JSON:**
   - Users can export the updated JSON file with all changes.

---

### Implementation Guidelines:

1. **React Flow Setup:**
   - Use the `react-flow` library to create the visualization.  
   - Define custom node components to display agent details.  
   - Implement edge rendering for relationships.

2. **JSON Parsing:**
   - Use JavaScript's `FileReader` API to handle drag-and-drop file uploads.  
   - Parse the JSON file and map it to React Flow nodes and edges.

3. **Editing Interface:**
   - Create a form or modal for editing agent details.  
   - Use controlled components to manage input fields.  
   - Update the JSON structure dynamically as users make changes.

4. **Export Functionality:**
   - Use the `JSON.stringify` method to convert the updated JSON structure into a downloadable file.  
   - Provide a button to trigger the export.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Validate JSON files during import to ensure they match the required structure.  
   - Display error messages for invalid files or missing fields.

6. **Styling:**
   - Use a modern UI library (e.g., Material-UI, Tailwind CSS) for styling.  
   - Ensure the interface is responsive and user-friendly.

### Example Use Case:

**Scenario:**  
A user wants to visualize and edit the relationships between agents in a marketing strategy team.

**Workflow:**
1. The user drags and drops a JSON file containing agent data into the interface.  
2. The system renders the agent hierarchy using React Flow.  
3. The user clicks on the "Content Creation Agent" node to edit its task prompt.  
4. The user updates the task prompt to "Develop blog posts, social media content, ads, and email campaigns."  
5. The user exports the updated JSON file with the changes.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Fully functional React Flow visualization for agent relationships.  
2. Drag-and-drop support for importing JSON files.  
3. Editable agent details (system prompts, task prompts, etc.).  
4. Export functionality for updated JSON files.  
5. Clean and intuitive user interface.  
6. Comprehensive documentation and unit tests.
