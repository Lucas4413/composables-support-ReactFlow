# Contextual Chunking Engine

**Description:**  
To enhance the **Super AI Agents Infrastructure**, we need to implement a **Contextual Chunking Engine** that ensures semantic coherence while chunking documents. Traditional chunking methods often break context, but this module will dynamically adjust chunk sizes, maintain cross-document context links, and handle multi-modal content (text, images, and tables) seamlessly. The engine will use **Ollama** to serve LLMs and **VLMs** (Vision-Language Models) for image chunking, with inspiration from [ChunkR.ai](https://www.chunkr.ai/) (open-source).

### Key Features and Requirements:

#### **1. Dynamic Chunk Sizing:**
   - Adjust chunk size based on content type (e.g., dense technical documents vs. conversational text).
   - Use transformer-based context windows to identify natural breakpoints.

#### **2. Multi-Modal Chunking:**
   - Handle text, images, and tables seamlessly.
   - Use **OCR** for extracting text from images.
   - Use table extraction techniques for structured data.

#### **3. Integration with LLMs and VLMs:**
   - Use **Ollama** to serve LLMs for text chunking.
   - Use **VLMs** for chunking images or extracting context from images within documents.

### Workflow:

1. **Document Upload:**
   - The user uploads a document (text, images, or tables) via the Gradio interface.

2. **Content Analysis:**
   - The engine analyzes the document to determine its content type (e.g., technical, conversational, mixed).

3. **Dynamic Chunking:**
   - Adjusts chunk size dynamically based on content type.
   - Uses transformer-based context windows to identify natural breakpoints.

4. **Multi-Modal Chunking:**
   - For text: Uses LLMs to chunk text while preserving semantic coherence.
   - For images: Uses VLMs and OCR to extract and chunk text from images.
   - For tables: Uses table extraction techniques to chunk structured data.

5. **Output:**
   - Returns semantically coherent chunks with cross-references (e.g., links between figures, tables, and text).

### Implementation Guidelines:

1. **Modular Design:**
   - Keep the chunking logic separate from the LLM and VLM integration.
   - Use dependency injection for LLM and VLM API integration.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling for OCR, table extraction, and LLM/VLM calls.
   - Retry failed operations with appropriate fallback mechanisms.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Design the engine to handle large documents and complex relationships.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for each chunking mode (text, images, tables).
   - Test edge cases (e.g., mixed content, poorly formatted documents).

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the API endpoints, data structures, and workflows.
   - Provide examples for different content types and use cases.

### Example Use Case:

**Document Upload:**  
A research paper with text, images, and tables.

**Workflow:**
1. The user uploads the research paper via the Gradio interface.
2. The engine analyzes the document and identifies sections, figures, and tables.
3. It dynamically chunks the text, ensuring semantic coherence and natural breakpoints.
4. It extracts text from images using OCR and chunks it appropriately.
5. It extracts structured data from tables and chunks it.
6. It maintains standards between figures, tables, and text.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. Fully functional **Contextual Chunking Engine**.
2. Dynamic chunk sizing based on content type.
3. Multi-modal chunking for text, images, and tables.
4. Integration with Ollama for LLMs and VLMs for image chunking.
5. Robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
6. Comprehensive documentation and unit tests.
